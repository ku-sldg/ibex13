This year's New Directions In Software Technology (NDIST) workshop is
focusing on computating and biology.  In particular, synthetic
biology.  Lots of interesting things going on.[^0]

[^0]:I didn't decide to blog on this until after about half of the
first day.  So, forgive lack of detail.

Opening talk gave some great examples of using biological systems to
model Boolean algebra.  I asked the question of why we use biology to
mimic abstractions derived from circuits.  The great answer I got was
that we're not.  Boole did his work as a mathematical abstraction and
*not* tied directly to circuits.  What we're doing is implementing a
useful abstraction, not mimicing digital circuits.  I wonder why when
not start with a Turing Machine rather than Boolean algebra, but I
think one can argue one is certainly prerequisite for the other.

Jay Sussman (MIT) gave a talk entitled "We Don't Understand Computing"
that was pretty interesting.

Interesting small group discussion.  One thing that came out is that
circuits
